## StateGenie

### What is StateGenie?

StateGenie provides annotation processor to generate `sealed interface` representing a defined set of states.
It gives you the flexibility of reusing a base model in different scenarios while also enabling you to add new
models over them based on your requirements reducing the repeated boiler plate code.
